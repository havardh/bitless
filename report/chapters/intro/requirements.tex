\subsection{Requirements}\label{intro:requirements}
We defined a set of functional and non-functional requirements
that we wanted to achieve in order to fulfill the given assignment.
They are summarized in Table \ref{tab:funref} and \ref{tab:nonfunref},
respectively.

FR1 through FR3 have to be utilized in order for the system to be MIMD.
FR4 through FR6 defines base requirements for the audio cores.
FR7 is important in order to optimize for low power usage. The base
requirements for the MCU is listed in FR9 through FR12.
