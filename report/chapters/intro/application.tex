\section{Application and effect on Architecture}

\todo{This section is subject to change and movement and is mostly just notes}

The application chosen for this project is audio processing. The MCU unit will
provide audio samples to the FPGA which in turn will process the samples and
return the result. As the FPGA contains multiple cores with multiple filters,
transforms and effects will be executed in parallel.

\subsection{Filters}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item FIR - Finite impulse response filter
	\item IRR - Infinite impulse response filter
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Low pass filter
	\item High pass filter
	\item Band filter
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Audio Effects}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reverb
	\item Echo
	\item Distortion
	\item Chorus
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Effect on architecture}

\paragraph{Goal}
 - To make a pipelined MIMD with cores executing different transforms and
filters.
   E.g. Input $=>$ FFT $=>$ IIR $=>$ IFFT $=>$ Output

\paragraph{Buffering}
 - The cores in the pipeline should have a shared memory in between each core to
 communicate
   E.g. Mem $<=>$ Core $<=>$ Mem $<=>$ Core ... $<=>$ Mem

\begin{itemize}
	\item Insight A: FFT transforms a window of samples into a Frequency image
for this window. The window is created by N samples.
  \item Effect: Data will be transfered through the pipeline in big chunks. One
new chunk will be transfered on each ADC cycle.
  \item Proposed solution: Each shared memory should be divided in two equally
sized pieces, A and B. $Core_i$ uses $A_{i-1}$ as input and $B_{i+1}$ as
output on cycle $2j$ and $B_{i-1}$ as input and $A_{i+1}$ on cycle $2j+1$ for
$j = 0,1,2,3,4$
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Insight $B_1$: If the a FFT is not applied a N
	\todo{N is already used for the number of samples per transform} bit sample
	will arrive at each ADC cycle.
  \item Insight $B_2$: A filter needs historic samples.
  \item Effect: Data will be transfered in small quantities, if the previously
scheme is used for samples at the start of the buffer historic data will not be
available.
  \item Proposed solution: Converge the buffer design to a circular buffer
design either at sample level or at some division of the buffer greater than 2.
\end{itemize}
