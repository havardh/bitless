This chapter details the results from all the tests in the previous chapter. It
also details whether the system as a whole has satisfied the project assignment.

\section{Assignment results}

While \textit{ChaosM} was able to fully function with one pipeline in
simulation, there was insufficient time to successfully integrate it on the FPGA
chip on the system. Therefore, the actual audio processing was never
successfully tested on the system. Consequently many of the Functional
Requirement Tests (FRTs) were not tested. However, the I/O controller was
successfully tested against both the SRAM and the FPGA chip when configured as
RAM. The PCB was also thoroughly tested. Following are the testing results of
these two components.
