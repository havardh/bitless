\section{Components}

The PCB group was eager to learn how modern PCB production is done, using the
same tools and technologies as the industry. Thus, our choice of components was
strongly driven by a smaller is better mindset. The use of BGA packages (for the
MCU and FPGA) was already given from the resources we had available and the fact
that Odd Rune Lykkebo had experience baking these.

We used 0805 surface-mount components as much as possible, because they were the
smallest packages we could comfortably solder. This caused a reduction in the
need for through-hole drilling on the PCB, which not only lowered the production
cost, but also gave us more area to work on as we could place components on both
sides, consequently minimizing the board size.

When picking components we did our best to get an overview of what the market
looked like, and weighed the components against each other to find the one best
suited for our needs. Supplementary components like capacitors and resistors
were not given this thorough evaluation, as they were requirements of
datasheets, but they had to follow the rules of minimum size 0805 and be surface
mounted.
