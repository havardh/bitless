\section{Components}

The PCB group was eager to learn how modern PCB production is done, using the
same tools and technologies as the industry. Thus, our choice of components was
strongly driven by a smaller is better mindset. The use of BGA packages (for
the MCU and FPGA) was already given from the resources we had available and the
fact that Odd Rune Lykkebo had experience baking these.

We used 0805 surface-mount components as much as possible, because they were the
smallest packages we could comfortably solder. This caused a reduction in the need for through-hole drilling on the PCB, which not only lowered the production cost, but also gave us more area to work on as we could place components on both sides, consequently minimizing the board size.
