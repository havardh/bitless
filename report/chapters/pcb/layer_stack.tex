\section{Layer Stack}

We had three primary voltage levels on the PCB -- 1.2V, 1.8V and 3.3V. To
minimize resistance in the power distribution system, we decided to dedicate a
layer on the PCB to be used as a shared power plane. Another plane was used for
common ground and covered the whole PCB (excluding non-grounded through-holes).
This is setup with a shared ground and split power plane is common practice for
modern PCB design.

As for the signal layers, the BGA packages we used had only 0.8 mm pitch between
its feets. This forced us to have more signal layers than we originally set out
for, to be able to fanout and escape the BGA packages. Using a QFP-like package
could probably have saved us some cost, but using BGA gave us a valuable
experience on modern PCB design.

We settled upon a total of 8 layers on the PCB.
