\section{Layer Stack}

We had three primary voltage levels on the PCB -- 1.2V, 1.8V and 3.3V. To
minimize resistance in the power distribution system, we decided to dedicate a
layer on the PCB to be used as a shared power plane. Another plane was used for
common ground and covered the whole PCB (excluding non-grounded through-holes).
This setup with a shared ground and split power plane is common practice for
modern PCB designs.

As for the signal layers, the BGA packages we used only had a 0.8 mm pitch between
its feet. This forced us to have more signal layers than we originally set out
for, in order to fanout and escape the BGA packages. Using a QFP-like package
could probably have saved us some cost, but using BGA gave us a valuable
experience on modern PCB design.

We settled upon a total of 8 layers on the PCB.
