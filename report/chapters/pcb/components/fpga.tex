\subsection{FPGA}

We first wanted the same FPGA that is mounted on the development cards
accessible in the software lab to make it easier to test and debug, but since
this was out of stock we changed to a slightly larger one.\todo{write something
more intelligent about the FPGA. Mention size, pwr consumption, etc..}
