\subsection{SRAM}

When faced with the option of SRAM vs DRAM, SRAM came off as the chip of choice
due to several reasons. While DRAM is cheaper than SRAM, we could stay
comfortably within the budget buying SRAM\todo{check once budget is complete},
and unlike DRAM, which is synchronous, SRAM is asynchronous, which means we do
not have to worry about the propagation of signals according to the clock
signal, making read/write easer. This was the main reason for choosing SRAM. As
an added bonus however, SRAM is more energy efficient because DRAM consumes
energy on regular intervals when it refreshes its memory values, while SRAM does
not need to refresh anything. This also makes SRAM faster.

We settled on a 16Mbit 1MHz chip that runs on 3.3V and is surface mounted.
