As this project requires us to implement a MIMD processor in VHDL, we realized
our design through implementing it in VHDL, and running the final processor on a
\todo{Replace ``Spartan-6'' and FPGA with references/links?}Spartan-6 FieldProgrammableGateArray.

Our MIMD processor design is was realized throughpipelined cores connected
sequentially in a pipeline of their own. Since the processor contains homogenous
cores, each core can receive and run the same instructions. To realize this as
an \todo{Fancy inline thingy explaining MultipleInstructionsMultipleData acronym}
``MIMD'', the first core in the sequential core-pipeline is the only one which
can work with the data given to said pipeline by the EBI bus. The next core then
works on the output of the first core, and in this fashion each core in the
pipeline works on its own data independently of the data any other core is
currently working on.

And each of the processor cores has its own instruction memory, so that they can
run each their own instructions, and that's how we have realized the \todo{Maybe add another fancy inline thingy here instead of qoutation marks?}
``Multiple Instruction'' part of the MIMD definition.
