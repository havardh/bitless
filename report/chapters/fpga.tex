\chapter{FPGA}\label{chapter:fpga}

The processor core was implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.
It consists of several audio processing pipelines, each
containing a set of homogenous processor cores and memories.

\todo{We need a better introduction here. Review what was
removed earlier and try to piece together something that is
suited for a "light" intro. E.g. what role does the FPGA play in
the system as a whole, why the chapter is structured the way it
is, etc.}
