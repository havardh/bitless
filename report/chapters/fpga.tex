\todo[inline]{Processor design}
As this project requires us to implement a MIMD processor in VHDL, we realized
our design by implementing it in VHDL, and running the final processing core on
a Spartan-6 FieldProgrammableGateArray.
\todo{Replace ``Spartan-6'' and FPGA with references/links?}
\\
Our MIMD processor design is based on pipelined cores connected sequentially in
a pipeline of their own. Since the processor contains homogenous cores, each
core can receive and run the same instructions. To realize this as an MIMD \todo{Fancy inline thingy explaining MultipleInstructionsMultipleData acronym}, the first core in
the sequential core-pipeline is the only one who can work with the data given to
said pipeline by the EBI bus. The next core then works on the output of the
first core, and as such each core in the pipeline works on its own data
independently of the data any other core is currently working on.
\\
And as each of the processor cores have their own instruction memory, so that
they can run each their own instructions, we have realized the ``Multiple
Instruction'' \todo{Maybe add another fancy inline thingy here instead of qoutation marks?} part of the MIMD definition.
\\
This chapter is structured in the following manner; First, we describe the
design of the processor core in more detail, and explain the reasoning behind
the general design principles we followed. Second, we describe the
aforementioned sequential pipeline in which the processor cores are implemented.
Third, we then explain the reasoning and design decisions behind the homogenous
processor cores used in the pipeline. Third, we describe the different memories
that the processor as a whole with all its cores utilize, from the instruction
memory, to the data memory, and the constant memory. Fourth,
we describe how the processor this chapter so far has detailed communicates with
the MCU and the rest of the PCB through the EBI bus. Fifth, we list and
describe how the assembly language the processor cores are designed for works,
as well as how it's meant to be utilized. Sixth, we explain and and show how the
testing of the VHDL/FPGA \todo{Re-phrase this in a better way somehow?} implementation
and methodology is discussed, including results.
