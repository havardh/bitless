\chapter{FPGA}\label{chapter:fpga}

As this project requires us to implement a MIMD processor in VHDL, we realized
our design through implementing it in VHDL, and running the final processor on a
\todo{Replace ``Spartan-6'' and FPGA with references/links?}Spartan-6 FieldProgrammableGateArray.

Our MIMD processor design is was realized throughpipelined cores connected
sequentially in a pipeline of their own. Since the processor contains homogenous
cores, each core can receive and run the same instructions. To realize this as
an \todo{Fancy inline thingy explaining MultipleInstructionsMultipleData acronym}
``MIMD'', the first core in the sequential core-pipeline is the only one which
can work with the data given to said pipeline by the EBI bus. The next core then
works on the output of the first core, and in this fashion each core in the
pipeline works on its own data independently of the data any other core is
currently working on.

And each of the processor cores has its own instruction memory, so that they can
run each their own instructions, and that's how we have realized the \todo{Maybe add another fancy inline thingy here instead of qoutation marks?}
``Multiple Instruction'' part of the MIMD definition.

%Need something to insert a line here, or some other visual cue to cue the reader in that we're done with introducing the FPGA design, we're now going to tell the reader what to expect from the rest of the fpga chapter (I would prefer to use "\\"-x10)

This chapter is structured in the following manner; First, in section \ref{section:fpga-design}
we describe the design of the processor core in more detail, and explain the
reasoning behind the general design principles we followed. Second, in section \ref{section:sequential-pipeline}
we describe the aforementioned sequential pipeline in which the processor cores
are implemented. Third in section \ref{section:fpga-processor-core} we explain
the reasoning and design decisions behind the homogenous processor cores used
in the pipeline. Fourth, in section \ref{section:fpga-internal-memory} we
continue with describing the different types of memories that the processor as
a whole with all its cores utilize, from the instruction memory, to the data
memory, and the constant memory. Fifth, in section \ref{section:fpga-buses} we
describe how the processor this chapter so far has detailed communicates with
the MCU and the rest of the PCB through the EBI bus. Sixth, in section \ref{fpga-isa}
we list and describe how the assembly language the processor cores are
designed for works, as well as how it's meant to be utilized. Seventh, in
section \ref{section:fpga-testing} we conclude this chapter by explaining and
showing how the testing of the  \todo{Re-phrase this in a better way somehow?}
VHDL/FPGA implementation and methodology is discussed, including the subsequent
results.
