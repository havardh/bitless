As this project requires us to implement a MIMD processor in VHDL, we realized
our design through implementing it in VHDL, and running the final processor on a
Spartan-6\cite{fpga-chip} Field-Programmable-Gate-Array.

Our MIMD processor design is was realized through pipelined cores connected
sequentially in a pipeline of their own. Since the processor consists of
homogenous cores, each core can receive and run the same instructions. To
realize this as a ``Multiple Instructions, Multiple Data'' (``MIMD''), the first
core in the sequential core-pipeline is the only one which can work with the
data given to said pipeline by the EBI bus. The next core then works on the
output of the first core, and in this fashion each core in the pipeline works on
its own data independently of the data any other core is currently working
on\footnote{This is how we realize the ``Multiple Data'' part of the MIMD
definition.}.

And each of the processor cores has its own instruction memory, so that they can
run each their own instructions, and that's how we have realized the ``Multiple
Instruction'' part of the MIMD definition.
