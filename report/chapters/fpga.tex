\chapter{FPGA}\label{chapter:fpga}

\todo[inline]{Insert small introduction here}
The processor design below was implemented in VHDL and runs on the FPGA. Is the MIMD in the solution.\\
\\
In this chapter the design process is explained in more detail, and detailed descriptions of the implementation and \emph{reasons} are given. Finnaly the testing phase and methodology is discussed, including results.
