Each group have implemented and tested 

\begin{description}
    \item[Functional requirement 1] \hfill \\
        \textit{The audio cores must consume different data and instruction streams. } \\
        \textbf{Test:} Initialize the audio processor with at least two pipelines
        containing one core. Program the two cores with two different programs and feed
        each pipeline with different data.\\
        \textbf{Pass:} The cores in each pipeline is able to read data from the input buffer,
        perform operations on the data and write the result to the pipelines output buffer.\\
    \item[Functional requirement 2] \hfill \\
        \textit{The processor cores should be arranged in different pipelines,
        each pipeline representing an audio channel.} \\
        \textbf{Test:} \\
        \textbf{Pass:} \\
    \item[Functional requirement 3] \hfill \\
        \textit{The audio processor must consist of at least two audio channels. } \\
        \textbf{Test:} Initialize the audio processor with two pipelines, where each of the 
        pipelines does calculations on an audio channel. Use a stereo wav-file and send
        the left channel through the first pipeline and the right channel through the
        second one. \\
        \textbf{Pass:} The data received from the the output buffer is equal to the
        data sent to the input buffer. \\
    \item[Functional requirement 4] \hfill \\
        \textit{The processor architecture should utilize 16 bit processing cores. } \\
        \textbf{Test:} \\

        \textbf{Pass:} \\
    \item[Functional requirement 6] \hfill \\
        \textit{The cores in the audio pipelines should share data with each other} \\
        \textbf{Test:} \\
        \textbf{Pass:} \\
    \item[Functional requirement 7] \hfill \\
        \textit{It must be possible to observe power consumption over certain components.} \\
        \textbf{Test:} \\
        \textbf{Pass:} \\
    \item[Functional requirement 8] \hfill \\
        \textit{The audio system should perform real time filtering on} \\
        \textbf{Test:} \\
        \textbf{Pass:} \\
    \item[Functional requirement 9] \hfill \\
        \textit{The microcontroller and the audio processor should communicate via ARMs} \\
        \textbf{Test:} \\
        \textbf{Pass:} \\
    \item[Functional requirement 10] \hfill \\
        \textit{The audio processor should be able to perform Hardware-accelerated FFTs.} \\
        \textbf{Test:} \\
        \textbf{Pass:} \\
    \item[Functional requirement 11] \hfill \\
        \textit{The MCU must have an SD card interface and a UART serial port.} \\
        \textbf{Test:} Copy a file to the SD card with the MCU, read the data on the SD card
        from an external device. Connect to the board with UART and write to an external device.\\
        \textbf{Pass:} The file is copied correctly and the external device receives the 
        transmitted data. \\
    \item[Functional requirement 12] \hfill \\
        \textit{The board should have buttons and LEDs.} \\

        \textbf{Test:} Run the audio processor with input data from a Micro SD card, and
        with data from an ADC. \\
        \textbf{Pass:} The PCB is equipped with both a Micro SD port and and ADC, and the
        MCU is able to fully control both of the peripherals.\\
