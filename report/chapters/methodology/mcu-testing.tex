\section{Testing the MCU Implementation}

This section describes the test written in software, and the energy measurements
done with Silicon Lab's \textit{energyAware Profiler}. The software tests can be
divided into to groups, Unit tests and Demo programs.

\subsection{Unit tests}

Unit tests were developed for the non-hardware dependent code. These are
utility components which executes correctly independently of the underlying
platform. The tests were written in the CppUTest framework \ref{} and executed
on each developers own laptop.

\subsection{Demo Programs}

<<<<<<< HEAD
While developing the software library interfacing with the hardware using {\bf
emlib} and {\bf CMSIS}, small demo programs where written. These programs verify
two things; that the software runs correcly, and that the underlying hardware
devices are connected according to the specifications. This was acccomplished by
running the program on both the PCB and the development kits available at the
lab.

\subsubsection{Transfer from ADC to DAC with DMA}
\paragraph{Testfile: sw/modules/adc/demo/ADD.c}

This test verifies that this pipeline is set up correctly. It confirms that the minijacks
are connected the correct GPIO ports. As the ports are the same on the development kit \ref{}
and the project's PCB, this test has been used to verify the PCB design and implementation.

This demo program sets up the ADC as sample source and DAC as the sample output. DMA is
used to copy from the ADC to an input buffer in the Internal RAM on the MCU. After 64 samples,
the CPU is interrupted and transfers the samples to the output buffer. A second DMA channel
copies from the output buffer to the DAC.

\todo{Remove?}Sets up a simple path from ADC to DAC.
Verifies that ADC, DAC are setup correctly.

\subsubsection{Transfer from ADC to DAC Through FPGA Mock}
\paragraph{Testfile: sw/modules/fpga/demo/fpga.c}
This demo is a copy of the previous test with the addition of deinterleaving and interleaving


Verifies that deinterleaving and interleaving works.

\subsubsection{copy-file.c}
Sets up MicroSD and copies the file sweet1.wav to sweet2.wav.
Verifies that SDCard is setup correctly.

\subsubsection{wavplayer.c}
Sets up the MicroSD, FPGA mock, DAC and DMA.
Verifies that audio can be played from SDCard to DAC.
