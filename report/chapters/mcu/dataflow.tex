\section{Dataflow}

When designing an energy efficient system, dataflow is of great
importance. The software on the MCU has been designed to
minimize the number of data stores and movements, and CPU usage
is kept to a minimum so that the processor can be turned off to
save energy. \todo[inline]{It seems natural to mention something
more about the different GG energy modes here, or somewhere
close - maybe a new subsection? This has also been mentioned
earlier in software architecture, so take a look there and see
if that can be moved up here. -JK}

\subsection{Peripherals} The MCU facilitates audio I/O from ADC,
DAC, SDCard and serial port interface to and from the FPGA.
\todo{is serial audio I/O implemented?}
\input{figures/sw/sample-flow} \todo[inline]{explain the figure
and refer to it in the text -JK}

\subsection{External Bus Interface} The MCU is connected to the
FPGA and SRAM through the EBI. This leads to easy interfacing
with these units as the EBI is memory mapped on the MCU.
Communicating with the FPGA is done by reading and writing to
memory.

\todo{more about how the bus is implemented on the MCU}

\subsection{Direct Memory Access} DMA provides the ability to
move data without the intervention of the CPU. This is used
extensively to implement the dataflow when the MCU is in a low
energy mode. The CPU is only used to configure and refresh the
DMA channels in between transfers. The MCU provides 12
independent DMA channels which can move data between
peripherals, RAM, Flash and the EBI.

The core dataflow path is from RAM on the MCU to the internal
buffers on the FPGA, and back again to RAM on the MCU. This uses
four DMA channels. \missingfigure{Figure showing RAM => FPGA =>
RAM}

In addition, a DMA is assigned for each ADC and DAC whenever
they are used as input and output, respectively. When SDCard is
used, the contents of the files are read and written directly to
and from RAM by the CPU.

\subsubsection{Deinterleaving of Samples}

When reading from both a WAV file and the ADC, samples from
the right and left channels are interleaved. The FPGA handles
both channels in separate pipelines. On the input side the
samples has to be deinterleaved and on output they are
interleaved again. This is the reason for using two DMA channels
for input and two for output. A complementary version of this
procedure is implemented on the CPU and power comparison plots
are included in the results section. \todo{Make sure they are. Rewrite for better flow - JK}

\missingfigure{Figure showing deinterleaving and interleaving}

The samples are deinterleaved by letting two DMA channels read
from the same source and write to the pipelines for correct
channel. The first DMA copies the samples for the left samples,
and start without a offset. The second DMA copies the samples
for the right samples and start with an offset of one sample.
Both DMAs read only every other sample and writes them
continuously to the FPGA input buffers.

The interleaving process on output side works in the same way.
The DMA reading from the pipeline containing the left samples
writes to the memory without a starting offset. The right
channel DMA writes with a offset by one sample. \todo[inline]{Rewrite for better flow - JK}

\subsubsection{Triggering Transfers}

All the DMA transfers are triggered by the use of one clock, the
sample clock. This clock is run at the sample speed (11kHz
\todo{Lets update this to the correct one}), when using the DAC
or ADC, or a arbitrary frequency when doing SD to SD. The clock
signal is fed into the Peripheral Reflex System of the MCU and
propagates through the system using the following scheme

Here both the DAC and ADC consumes the PRS signal originated
from TIMER0. The DMA copying from the ADC to the RAM buffer and
the two DMAs performing the deinterleaving of the input samples
receives a pulse each time the ADC has buffered up $N$ samples.
They then perform a sequence of copy actions resulting in the
input samples ending up inside the pipeline buffers of the FPGA.
On the other side the DAC sends a pulse to the DMA that feeds it
samples in conjunction with the two DMAs performing the
interleaving of the samples returned from the FPGA pipelines.
