\section{Pitfalls}

We made a lot of experiences during the process of this project and have listed the most prominent ones in this section.

\begin{description}
   \item[PCB Schematics] \hfill \\
   Double check custom footprints and make sure the pads are correct according to the datasheet.

Triple check all signal connections going to and from any SMD processors, and look especially out for typos. If you lose a signal (or a bus), there is no way of getting access to the pins on the chip. This proved to be a major time sink for us.
   \item[VHDL Implementation and Simulation] \hfill \\
   Start testing and synthesizing the design early. Bugs introduced early on can have major ripple effects on a completed design if they are not detected early in the process.

Timing simulation is a very manhour intensive process of the VHDL development. It is advantageous to learn how the timing simulation works early on in the project.
