\section{Potential Improvements}

There have been several improvements we have considered for this project, and
below we will detail on the most prominent improvements that we were unable to
implement.

\subsection{\textit{ChaosM} improvements}
\subsubsection{Further optimize the floating point operations}
If the floating point operations had been optimized further, the pipeline inside of the core could have run faster too.
Thereby increasing the speed of \textit{ChaosM}, and consequently also being more energy efficient, since the programs can finish faster on the FPGA.

\subsubsection{Spend more efforts on timing simulations}
Timing simulations differ critically from behavourial simulations.
The key difference between is that timing simulations simulate how the system will work on the FPGA with signal propagations,
in addtion to accounting for the time it takes for signals to propagate through the logic circuits.
This can reveal locations in the VHDL design where a signal might become undefined, or have the wrong value at the right time, where a behavourial simulation would not reveal these problems.
This is discussed more in section \ref{conclusion:pitfalls}.

\subsection{I/O controller improvements}
There are no functional improvements to the I/O controller which were not implemented into the project.
But beyond functional improvements, there was a wish to write a program which would show
real-time graphs of the the audio spectrums going into and out of the FPGA chip.

\subsection{PCB improvements}
reduce pcb cost by only using drill holes -
