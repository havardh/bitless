\chapter{PCB}\label{chapter:pcb}

While the main objective of the project is to create a MIMD system, which essentially can be completed by FPGA design alone, everything depends on the PCB to complete the system. It is the final step in realizing the system as a whole, going from a theoretical dimension of design and ideas, to a physical one with components and electricity.

This chapter will attempt to explain in detail each step during the design process of the circuit board. The sections have been ordered as much as possible according to which stage in the process they occurred, with schematic drawings as the first step, choice of components as the second, followed by layout, and finally the test plan. While we have tried to divide these steps to our best ability, some of them are intertwined, like schematics and components, as you need of course to decide on what components your card will have before actually drawing them, unless you have a particular fondness for doing unnecessary work.
