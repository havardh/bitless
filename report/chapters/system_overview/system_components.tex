\subsection{MCU}
The microcontroller unit is a Giant Gecko by Energy Micro (EFM32GG990F1024) which is an energy friendly MCU capable of shutting down components that are not in use. It does this by defining several levels of sleep mode where the outer stage has everything on, and for each step inwards a new set of components are shut off.\missingfigure{add the fancy energy circle figure?} This enables the MCU to keep I/O components working while shutting off the processor unit on the chip.

The MCU handles all I/O, effectively acting as the link between the FPGA and the peripherals. Sound input is either gathered from a file on the SD-card or as a stream from the audio-in jack on the board, and then passed on to the FPGA. In addition it controls the running program on the FPGA, providing an easy channel for changing FPGA behavior.
\subsection{FPGA}
The FPGA is programmed with a MIMD architecture which enables task parallelism. While this is great for parallelism, it comes at the cost of a more complex process architecture, which in turn increases the size of each core. This limits the number of cores available on the FPGA, but we were able to fit ten\todo{update with final number} cores which is enough to apply the filters we want.
\subsection{Memory}
The MCU has an internal memory of
