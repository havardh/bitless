\section{System Architecture}

The system is built around an I/O control unit that organizes all data movement
on board. Analog audio signals enter the system through a minijack and gets
routed to the hardware accelerator by the I/O controller for audio manipulation.
At the same time, processed audio is routed back from the accelerator and to the
output minijack.
