\section{System Architecture}

Since we use a microcontroller from Eneryg Micro, which in turn is a
Cortex microcontroller, the software is built upon the CMSIS codebase
from ARM.
The Giant Gecko microcontrollers is supplied with a peripheral API,
called emlib which builds upon CMSIS and can be used to initialize and 
control all of the perihperals.
We have based our code and programming model on how it is done in emlib.

The application is struchtured into directories for
