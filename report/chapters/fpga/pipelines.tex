title?}

\missingfigure{We should have a figure of the pipeline here, we've got several
in google docs, use/pretty up one of those should suffice to give an
architectural overview}

In the above figure, \todo[inline]{insert reference to above figure} we
illustrate how the processor connects all the processing cores together on the
FPGA.

Though the \todo[inline]{reference to the same above figure} figure above shows
that we've connected the \todo{Maybe insert EBI references?} EBI-bus to each
processing core, during normal non-debugging runtime the cores only
``communicate'' in the manner described in the next paragraph, and not through
the EBI-bus. The EBI-bus is used only as inter-communication between the cores
for debugging purposes.

The manner in which the cores ``communicate'' with each other is instead by the
two-stage ring-buffers between them. For each clockcycle belonging to the
pipeline of processor cores, they switch which one of the ones preceding they
read from, and which of the ones following they write to\footnote{This is where
the ``Multiple Data'' part of the ``MIMD'' definition is enacted
in our processor.}.

\subsection{In action}

So the input of the FPGA goes to the first core in each ``core-pipeline'', where
the first core works on the sample, before giving it over to the next core in
said pipeline.
