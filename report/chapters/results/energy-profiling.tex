\subsection{Power comparision using energy profiling}

An important feature included with Simplicity Studio and Silicon Labs microcontrollers
is the possibility to easily monitor the power consumption on the running system.
This allows for easier development of energy efficient code, and can help
with finding and tracing down bugs.
This is a feature given by Silicon Lab's \textit{energyAware Profiler}, and it is thoroughly
described in Silicon Labs application note \cite{energydbg}.

Most of the code used in this project is already based on highly optimized
examples with respect to energy efficiency.
The example provided by Silicon Labs named {\bf preamp} is comparable to the main
DMA dataflow, as their net work is similar. Both program uses DMA and moves samples
from ADC to DAC. The difference is that the non-example code includes deinterleaving
and interleaving of the audio channels. Refere to Section \ref{sec:dataflow}
for details. Figures \ref{fig:fpga} and \ref{fig:preamp}
shows the energy consumption by the Microprocessor when running each program.

\input{figures/sw/preamp}

As the figures suggests the energy consumption for each program are practically equal.
