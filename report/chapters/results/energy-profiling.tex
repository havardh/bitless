\subsubsection{Power comparision using energy profiling}

The example provided by Silicon Labs named {\bf preamp} is comparable to the main
DMA dataflow, as their net work is similar. Both program uses DMA and moves samples 
from ADC to DAC. The difference is that the non-example code includes deinterleaving
and interleaving of the audio channels. Refere to section \ref{} for details. Figures \ref{fig:fpga} and \ref{fig:preamp}
shows the energy consumption by the Microprocessor when running each program.

\input{figures/sw/fpga}

\input{figures/sw/preamp}

As the figures suggests the energy consumption for each program are practically equal.
