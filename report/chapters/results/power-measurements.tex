\section{Power Measurements}

Since this is the report of the energy efficiency group, all components of
system the have been chosen with energy efficiency in mind. In order to measure
the efficiency of our design decisions, a set of power measurements were
performed. This section outlines the results of those measurements.

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
	State & FPGA                         & Audio source & Sense3v3 & Sense1v8 \\
	\hline \\
	A     & Idle                         & -            & 140mA    & 75mA \\
	B     & Computational simple filters & ADC          & -        & - \\
	C     & Computational heavy filters  & ADC          & -        & - \\
        D     & Computational simple filters & SD-card      & -        & - \\
        E     & Computational heavy filters  & SD-card      & -        & -
