\section{Power Measurements}\label{power_measurements}

All components of the system have been chosen with energy efficiency in mind. In
order to measure the efficiency of the design decisions, a set of power
measurements were performed. This section outlines the results of those
measurements.

\subsection{System}
Since this project has a energy efficient perspective, Table \ref{tab:results/power-measurement}
shows how the system performs during different states.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
	System State & FPGA                         & Audio source & Sense3v3 & Sense1v8 \\
	\hline \\
	A     & Idle                         & -            & 140mA    & 75mA \\
	B     & Computational simple filters & ADC          & -        & - \\
	C     & Computational heavy filters  & ADC          & -        & - \\
        D     & Computational simple filters & SD-card      & -        & - \\
        E     & Computational heavy filters  & SD-card      & -        & -
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:results/power-measurement}
    \caption{System load power measurements}
\end{table}

\paragraph*{}

As Table \ref{tab:results/power-measurement} reflects, the system was never
fully implemented, thus states B through E were not possible to test.
