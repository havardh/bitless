\section{Power Measurements}

As the energy group we have designed all components of our system
with energy efficiency in mind. In order to measure the efficiency 
of our design decisions a set of power measurements were performed.
This section outlines the results of those measurements.

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
	State & FPGA                         & Audio source & Sense3v3 & Sense1v8 \\
	\hline \\
	A     & Idle                         & -            & 140mA    & 75mA \\
	B     & Computational simple filters & ADC          & -        & - \\
	C     & Computational heavy filters  & ADC          & -        & - \\
        D     & Computational simple filters & SD-card      & -        & - \\
        E     & Computational heavy filters  & SD-card      & -        & -
