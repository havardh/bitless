\subsection{I/O Controller Results}

The main objective for the I/O Controller was to control all periherals on the board.
This was successfully accomplished. Although the ChaosM Core on the FPGA was not able
to produce any stable results, the I/O Controller was able to communicate with the
FPGA though the EBI bus in a deterministic way. This was proved by setting the
FPGA up as RAM and writing and reading to it over EBI.
