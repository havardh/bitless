\subsection{I/O controller Results}

The main objective for the I/O controller was to control all periherals in the system.
This was successfully accomplished. Although \textit{ChaosM} on the FPGA was not able
to produce any stable results, the I/O controller was able to communicate with the
FPGA though the EBI bus in a deterministic way. This was proved by setting the
FPGA up as RAM and writing and reading to it over EBI.
