\section{Project conclusion}

This project has been immensely demanding, requiring a lot of hard work and many
late hours. Even so, all of us found it to be a very interesting and rewarding
project. From the start of the course, the group was split up into three
subgroups: FPGA, software, and PCB. This division made it easy to divide the
labour between the respective groups. For all three of the subgroups, a vast
amount of hours were spent on just learning the respective fields. The learning
curve has been tough, but rewarding.

While the system was not completed due to \textit{ChaosM} never being
implemented on the FPGA chip, we did manage to prove through the VHDL
simulations that the design had promise if working correctly. Nevertheless,
taking into the account all the hacks and fixes on the PCB, the I/O controller
and the PCB were successfully implemented in their entirety.

\subsection{Expenses}
The project expenses are listed in Table~\ref{tab:budget}. The budget was exceeded by 884 NOK.
