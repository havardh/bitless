\chapter{Conclusion}

This chapter contains our conclusion, as well as our opinion of the project,
pitfalls we believe later generations can avoid by keeping in mind from early on
in the project, and finally our budget.

\section{Conclusion}

This project has been immensely demanding, requiring a lot of hard work and many
late hours. Even so, all of us of found it to be
a very interesting and rewarding project. From the start of the course, the
group was split up into three subgroups: FPGA, software, and PCB. This division
made it easy to divide the labour between the respective groups. For
all three of the subgroups, a vast amount of hours were spent on just learning our
respective fields. The learning curve was tough, but rewarding. 



\subsection{Pitfalls to be avoided}\label{conclusion:pitfalls}

Below we have compiled a list of issues we believe new groups should keep in
mind when starting out on the TDT4295 adventure:
