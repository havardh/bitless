\section{Project conclusion}

This project has been immensely demanding, requiring a lot of hard work and many
late hours. Even so, all of us of found it to be
a very interesting and rewarding project. From the start of the course, the
group was split up into three subgroups: FPGA, software, and PCB. This division
made it easy to divide the labour between the respective groups. For
all three of the subgroups, a vast amount of hours were spent on just learning our
respective fields. The learning curve have been tough, but rewarding.
