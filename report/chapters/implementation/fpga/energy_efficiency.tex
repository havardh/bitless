\subsection{Energy Efficiency}

\textit{ChaosM} is designed with a basic idea of energy efficiency. Since the
different cores in each pipeline perform different tasks, it is natural for them
to finish independently of each other. Therefore, \textit{ChaosM} is designed so
that it is possible to turn off the individual cores once they finish operating.
This functionality has a neglegible effect on the power consumption of an FPGA
and therefore doesn't affect energy efficiency on this particular system. If the
\textit{ChaosM} design was recreated as hardware on an integrated circuit,
however, this functionality could improve energy effieciency.
