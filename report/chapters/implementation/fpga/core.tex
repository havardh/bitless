\subsection{Processor Core}\label{subsec:fpga-processor-core}

Following comes the design considerations and the implementations of the
homogenous processor cores in \textit{ChaosM}.

\subsubsection{Design Considerations}

The processor core in \textit{ChaosM} is designed to be able to perform audio processing in real-time, as well as being as power efficient as possible.
Since the FPGAs power usage is close to constant, the best way to save power is to reduce the time the whole board is active.
The best way for the core to contribute to this is, to execute the programs as fast as possible.
Thus, the processor core has been designed with the two following principles in mind:

\begin{itemize}
	\item As high throughput as possible.
	\item Support the instructions needed to perform the audio processing.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation}

In order for the core to be as efficient as possible, a pipelined processor
design was implemented. The pipelined core design consists of the following
stages:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Instruction Fetch \label{stage:if}
	\item Instruction Decode \label{stage:id}
	\item Memory \label{stage:mem}
	\item Execute \label{stage:ex}
	\item Write back \label{stage:wb}
\end{enumerate}

A change from the classic pipelined processor designs, is that the memory stage comes before the execution stage.
This is because the load and store instructions does not need the ALU to calculate the memory address.
Thus the processor is able to prevent \textit{all} data dependecies by forwarding data from the different stages.

For simplicity, the core does not have a hazard control unit implemented for branching.
\todo{Confirm this in the final edition of the code}Instead it relies on the programmer to add two no-operations after a branch.
