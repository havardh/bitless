\todo[inline]{The below picture is wrong!!! It needs the amount of cores filled
with the programs the demo will run!}

The FPGA design consists of several audio processing pipelines, as illustrated in
figure \ref{fig:pipeline_architecture}. These contain several processing cores
separated by data buffers. Each audio processing pipeline processes one channel
of sound data.
