\textit{ChaosM} consists of two audio processing pipelines, as illustrated in
Figure \ref{fig:pipeline_architecture}. These contain up to four processing cores
connected by data buffers. Each audio processing pipeline corresponds to one audio channel, operating on audio samples as elementary data elements.
The input/output frequency is directly tied to the sample rate of the input, which acts as a secondary clock input. The main system clock runs on the order of MHz, while this sample clk is in the order of kHz and acts as a deadline for when new I/O is due.
