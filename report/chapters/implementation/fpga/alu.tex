\subsection{ALU}\label{subsec:fpga-alu}

Which operations were implemented in the ALU was decided based on behalf of what
was neccessary for the Fourier-transform, sound processing, and on whether the
instruction set had room for the encoding of the operations.

Division was not implemented in hardware in order for all instructions to be
single-cycle. However, division can be done using floating point multiplication
or by a regular long division algorithm in software.
