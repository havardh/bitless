\subsection{Assembler}

Writing programs for a self-constructed ISA is cumbersome without utility
programs like compilers or assemblers. Thus, we wrote a simple assembler in
Haskell, the \textit{Hassembler}. It counts about 250 lines of code and uses the
monadic parser combinator library Parsec. The source code in its entirety is
released under a BSD3 licence available for download at
\url{https://github.com/terjr/hassembler}.
