\subsubsection{Bus interface}

While not strictly a component, the databus is still an important part of the
PCB design. The MCU natively supports two bus interfaces, I2C and EBI, of which
the latter was used. This was done because I2C as a serial bus has more limited
bandwidth compared to the EBI, which support 16 bit words. The need for speed
stems from the requirement of streaming at least two audio channels live between
the MCU and FPGA components. As an added bonus, the EBI bus is compatible with
SRAM chip interfaces which proved useful when including extra memory in the
design.

In addition to the EBI bus there is a special control bus with a width of 3
signals going between the MCU and FPGA. This bus is available for the software
and FPGA group to use as needed, for instance for interrupts or other forms of
synchronization and status signaling.
