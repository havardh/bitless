\subsubsection{MCU}

The choice of MCU was limited to microcontrollers from Silicon Labs, which made
the controllers already present on the development kits an attractive choice
since they were already familiar to the software group. So the choice fell on
the Giant Gecko EFM32GG990F1024, which is a very energy friendly MCU that is
capable of shutting down unused components. This enables the MCU to keep I/O
components working while shutting off the processor unit, effectively reducing
energy consumption.
