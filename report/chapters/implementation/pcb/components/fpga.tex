\subsubsection{FPGA}

The choice of FPGA was based on available hardware at the software lab, because the development cards
there offered possibilities for testing and debugging before the PCB was ready. Due to the store being out of stock on that specific chip, a slightly larger one was chosen. \todo{write something
more intelligent about the FPGA. Mention size, pwr consumption, etc..}
