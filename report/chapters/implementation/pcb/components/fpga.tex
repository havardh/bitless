\subsubsection{FPGA}

The choice of FPGA was based on available hardware at the software lab, because
the development cards there offered possibilities for testing and debugging
before the PCB was ready. Due to the store being out of stock on that specific
chip, a slightly larger one was chosen. \todo{write something more intelligent
about the FPGA. Mention size, pwr consumption, etc..}
