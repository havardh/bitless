\subsubsection{FPGA}

The choice of FPGA was based on available hardware at the software lab, since
the development cards there offered opportunities for testing and debugging
prior to when the PCB was ready. Due to the store being out of stock on that
specific chip, a slightly larger one was chosen, which is the Xilinx Spartan 6
XC6SLX45.
