\subsubsection{Audio Circuitry}

The two minjacks are necessary for inputting and outputting sound on the system. The input port requires two operational amplifier circuits to supply the I/O controller with audio signals of appropriate voltage levels. The circuit schematics were copied over from equivalent schematics found on Silicon Labs development kits.
