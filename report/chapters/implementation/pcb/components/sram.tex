\subsubsection{SRAM}

To extend the memory of the MCU, an external memory module was added to the
board. During the evaluation of SRAM vs DRAM, SRAM came off as the chip of
choice due to several reasons. While DRAM is cheaper than SRAM, it was possible
to stay within the budget buying SRAM, and unlike DRAM, which is synchronous,
SRAM is asynchronous, which means there is no need to worry about the
propagation of signals and clock synchronization, making read/writes easier.
This is the main reason why SRAM was chosen.

As an added bonus, however, SRAM is more energy efficient since DRAM consumes
energy on regular intervals when it refreshes the memory values, while SRAM does
not refresh anything. This also makes SRAM faster.

Final choice fell upon a 16Mbit 1MHz chip that runs on 3.3V, surface mounted.
