\subsubsection{Power Supply}

The power supply is a big part of the design, consisting of several components.
Being the energy efficiency group, maximum power utilization has been a high
priority, making it very important that as little power as possible goes to
waste. When deciding on a design, the work of previous groups was examined,
particularly that of the energy efficiency group of 2012. Anything before 2012
had more or less used the same power supply, which was designed to transform any
excess power into heat. This is a simple and effective design, but not very
efficient in terms of power saving as it utilizes only a fraction of the input
power.

Fortunately, the energy efficiency group of 2012 did a solid job on their power
supply, using a switch-mode regulator that is able to output 3.3V from any input
voltage ranging from 4.75V up to 18V with an efficiency of 83-90\% \todo{add
reference to sr10s3v3 datasheet}. This is very efficient, so most of the design
was copied except for a change in current sensors, which is explained in detail
below.

\paragraph{Voltage regulators}

The design is based on a switch-mode regulator that transforms DC input into
3.3V\todo{sr10s3v3 reference}, and a linear regulator\todo{linreg reference}
that transforms 3.3V into 1.2V and 1.8V, see Appendix~\ref{apx:schematics}
(File: power\_supply.SchDoc). The switch-mode gets an input voltage typically at
9V or 12V which, as mentioned, is transformed into 3.3V and kept stable by
capacitors. This in turn supplies the 3.3V input for the linear voltage
regulator that delivers both the 1.2V and the 1.8V output. Originally it was
intended to disable the 1.8V domain entirely, running the whole board on 1.2V
and 3.3V, but as the FPGA was changed midway to a slightly larger one, the FPGA
flash also had to be changed and the new one required 1.8V.

The setup
delivers power at these three voltages, with high efficiency. Very little power
goes to waste in the switch-mode regulator, and while the linear regulator
transforms power into heat, transforming from 3.3V instead of, for example 9V,
is a large improvement.

\paragraph{Current sensors} \label{psu:current_sensors}

The main issue with the original design was that the current sensors were not
sensitive enough for low voltages, which resulted in inaccurate measurements. To
remedy this the current sensors were changed to more fitting ones. One has been
placed on the 3.3V power plane, while the other sits just before the linear
regulator. This way, it is possible to separate the 3.3V plane from the 1.2V and
1.8V, which enables analysis of MCU and FPGA power consumption in comparison
with the peripherals. In addition, the entire board consumption can be measured
at the PWR\_SRC pins located right after the DC input connector, see Appendix~\ref{apx:schematics}
(File: power\_supply.SchDoc).\todo{Refer to
measurements section once it is completed for more details.}

The output from
the current sensors have each been connected to an ADC on the MCU, which makes
it possible to perform on-the-go measurements on-chip. However, by performing
measurements using the MCU the results are skewed, as reading the ADC increases
power consumption. Therefore, measuring sockets have been added to allow for
reading the current sensor output on an external device, such as a development
board, making for more accurate readings.

\paragraph{Power by USB} \label{psu:usb}

An extra feature that was added was the ability to power the board
from USB. The USB 1.x and 2.0 standard specifies that a constant
power draw of 500mA at 5.0V $\pm$ 5\% can be provided.
\footnote{http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb\_20\_070113.zip}
\todo[inline]{Add reference to the USB specification.} This should suffice for
normal operation. USB chargers will in most cases provide support for
current draws in the 1500mA to 2000mA range, so using one of these should
definitely be enough to provide power through the USB port.

Even when using the normal power socket as the primary power supply, parts of
the board will still be powered through USB. This includes the UART-USB bridge
and the related TX and RX LEDs. By doing it this way all parts related to USB
connectivity will be completely powered down when no USB cable is connected.
