\subsubsection{USB-UART}

As a backup solution for communication with the MCU, other than the debug
port, a UART interface was added in form of a header that could be soldered
on to the board if needed. Should all other things fail, UART, beeing a simple
serial interface, would be a viable fallback solution. Both for debugging aswell
as piping sound in and out, although not in realtime. In order to improve 
usability of the serial interface a USB-UART bridge chip was added to the design
connected to a micro USB connector. 

While originally added as a backup solution for communication, the USB interface
was used for all its worth by the software group. And a script allowing for debugging
of the FPGA by facilitating communication between a PC and the FPGA using a specially
designed MCU program was added. \todo{Reference to the, hopefully existing, SW section
talking about the python script}

The USB connector, in addition to providing an interface to the MCU's UART
interface, also provides the second possible power source as outlined in 
section~\ref{psu:usb}.
