\subsubsection{USB-UART}

As a backup solution for communication with the MCU other than the debug
port, a UART interface was added in form of a header. Should all other things fail, UART, being a simple
serial interface, would be a viable fallback solution, both for debugging as well
as piping sound in and out, although not in realtime. In order to improve 
usability of the serial interface, a USB-UART bridge chip was added to the design
connected to a micro USB connector.

While originally intended as a backup solution for communication, the USB interface
proved very useful for the software group. A script enabling debugging
of the FPGA by facilitating communication between a PC and the FPGA using a specially
designed MCU program was written and implemented. \todo{Reference to the, hopefully existing, SW section
talking about the python script}

The USB connector, in addition to providing an interface to the MCU's UART
interface, also provides a second power source as outlined in section~\ref{psu:usb}.
