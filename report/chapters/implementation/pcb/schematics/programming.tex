\subsubsection{Programming Interfaces}

\paragraph{FPGA programming} The FPGA can be programmed in
numerous configurations, all of which has distinct features and
capabilities described in the Spartan-6 FPGA Configuration User
Guide. To avoid ruining the programmability, a decision was made
to go for the simplest and less error-prone
configuration; a JTAG interface directly to the chip.

However, JTAG programming does not provide persistence -- the
FPGA would have to be reprogrammed every time it powered up.
This was not a very ideal solution, so an FPGA
configuration flash memory was added, from which the FPGA could read its
initial configuration at startup. Xilinx provides schematics to
daisy-chain the regular JTAG with a JTAG interface to the FPGA
flash, making it easy to implement. Using this setup both the
FPGA and the flash will be programmed simultaneously, and unlike
the FPGA the flash will retain the program when powered down.
When powered up again the FPGA will look to the flash for its
initial program.

\paragraph{MCU programming} Putting out programming headers for
the Giant Gecko is a much simpler procedure. The 20-pin ARM
debug pinout is well documented in application notes and is easy
to set up.

In addition to programming the MCU, the debug header enables
tracing running programs and make use of the energy profiler
provided by Energy Micro.
