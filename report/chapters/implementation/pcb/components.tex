\subsection{Components}

The PCB was produced using the same tools and technologies that are commonly
used by the industry, which influenced the choice of components to be driven by
a ``smaller is better'' mindset. The use of BGA packages (for the MCU and FPGA)
was already given from the provided resources and the fact that Odd Rune Lykkeb√∏
had experience baking these.

norwegian than english, and it should be divided up into multiple sentences if
possible}As much as possible was chosen as surface-mount components in
the 0805 size, because it was the recommended hand-soldering
size, and because this caused a reduction in the need for
through-hole drilling on the PCB. Not only did this lower the production cost,
but also provided more area to work on as it was possible to place components on
both sides, consequently minimizing the board size.

Most components were picked from Farnell's inventory. Supplementary components
like capacitors and resistors were not given a thorough evaluation since their
specifications were listed as requirements by the datasheets, but they had to
follow the rules of minimum size 0805 and be surface mounted.
