\subsection{Components}

The PCB was produced using the same tools and technologies that are commonly
used by the industry, which influenced the choice of components to be driven by
a ``smaller is better'' mindset. The use of BGA packages (for the MCU and FPGA)
was already given from the provided resources and the fact that Odd Rune Lykkebø
had experience baking these.

For most components, \emph{surface-mount device} (SMD) versions were
preferred, because this caused a reduction in the need for through-hole drilling
on the PCB. For capacitors and resistors, which were all SMDs, 0805 was the chosen size because it
was the recommended minimum hand-soldering size. Not only did this lower the
production cost, but also provided more area to work on as it was possible to
place components on both sides, consequently minimizing the board size.

Most components were picked from Farnell's inventory. Supplementary components
like capacitors and resistors were not given a thorough evaluation since their
specifications were listed as requirements by the datasheets, but they had to
follow the rules of minimum size 0805 and be surface mounted.
