\subsection{Components}

The PCB was produced using the same tools and technologies as is
commonly used by the industry, which influenced the choice of
components to be driven by a smaller is better mindset. The use
of BGA packages (for the MCU and FPGA) was already given from
the provided resources and the fact that Odd Rune Lykkeb√∏ had
experience baking these.

As much as possible was chosen as surface-mount components in
the 0805 size, because it was the recommended hand-soldering
size, and because this caused a reduction in the need for
through-hole drilling on the PCB. Not only did this lower the
production cost, but also provided more area to work on as it
was possible to place components on both sides, consequently
minimizing the board size.

Most components were picked from Farnell's inventory.
Supplementary components like capacitors and resistors were not
given a thorough evaluation as their specifications were listed
as requirements by the datasheets, but they had to follow the
rules of minimum size 0805 and be surface mounted.
