\subsection{Schematics}

The development tool used to design the PCB was Altium Designer 2013. Each sheet
contains components relevant to what is routed in it, which means that large
components that consist of several blocks, such as the FPGA and MCU, are spread
out across different schematics. This has been done because we found it more
intuitive to have as many involved components as possible on the same sheet
instead of connecting loads of cables across sheets. The schematics themselves
can be viewed in Appendix~\ref{apx:schematics} \todo{review, rewrite}

From early on we were strongly advised to make things as easy as possible for
ourselves, which meant that whenever we found premade drawings or schematics of
something we wanted to implement that had been tested and were known to work, we
should copy it. So we did. Mostly we used schematics from datasheets, but we
also looked at what the energy efficiency group of 2012 had done before us on
their power supply, in addition to double checking this with the datasheets for
the relevant components.

We also focused on adding backup solutions and debugging options in case
something would fail due to PCB errors.\todo{rewrite, add more about being able
to fall back on other protocols should one fail, and the mapping of unused
pins..}
