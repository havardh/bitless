\section{FPGA}\label{chapter:fpga}

The processor design was implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It consists of
two audio processing pipelines, each containing four homogenous processor cores.
The processor cores are turing complete processing units connected to
constant memory, an input buffer, an output buffer, and instruction memory.
Each core exchanges data through the input/output buffers. Data from the MCU
is written into the input buffer of the first core, and read back from the
output buffer of the last core.

With this design, each pipeline of cores run a set of filters, for instance
a fourier transform, a frequency filter, an inverse fourier transform, and an
effect on the stream running through the audio pipeline.
