\section{FPGA}\label{chapter:fpga}

\textit{ChaosM} consists of two audio processing pipelines, each containing four
homogenous processor cores. The processor cores are turing complete processing
units connected to constant memory, an input buffer, an output buffer, and
instruction memory. Each core exchanges data through the input/output buffers.
Data from the I/O controller is written into the input buffer of the first core, and read
back from the output buffer of the last core.

With this design, each pipeline of cores can run a set of filters, for instance
a fourier transform, a frequency filter, an inverse fourier transform, and an
effect on the audio data stream running through the audio pipelines of \textit{ChaosM}.

\subsection{Energy Efficiency}
Since a Spartan-6 Xilinx processor draws approximately the same amount of current
independently of the instructions \textit{ChaosM} have in its instruction registers,
testing and designing \textit{ChaosM} for energy efficiency is something this project
has not attempted to any serious degree.
