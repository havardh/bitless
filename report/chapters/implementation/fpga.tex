\section{FPGA}\label{chapter:fpga}

The processor design was implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It consists of
two audio processing pipelines, each containing four homogenous processor cores.
The homogenous processing core is a Turing-complete processing core connected to
constant memory, input buffer, output buffer, and instruction memory. Except for
the first and last core in each audio pipeline, all the cores are connected
through the input/output-buffers, where the next core's input buffer is the
previous core's outputbuffer.

With this design, each pipeline of cores run a set of filters, say a
Fourier-Transform, a frequency filter, an inverse Fourier-Transform, and a final
non-filtering effect on the audio stream running through the audio pipeline.
