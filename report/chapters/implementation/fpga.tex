\section{ChaosM}\label{chapter:fpga}

The \textit{ChaosM} architecture consists of two audio processing pipelines, each containing four
homogeneous processor cores. Each processor core has access to separate input, output, and constant memory modules (memory modules containing constant values), in addition to instruction memory, as partially shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline_architecture}. Each core exchanges data
through the input/output buffers. Data from the I/O controller is written into
the input buffer of the first core, and read back from the output buffer of the
last core.

With this design, each pipeline of cores (hereafter occasionally referred to as the ``audio pipeline'' for context clarity), can run a set of filters, for instance
a Fourier transform, a frequency filter, an inverse Fourier transform, and an
effect on the audio data stream running through the audio pipelines of
\textit{ChaosM}.

The rest of this section details several aspects of \textit{ChaosM}; the audio
pipelines, how \textit{ChaosM} communicates with the rest of the system, the
instruction set architecture (ISA), the different types of memory, the homogeneous
processor core, the energy efficient implementations, and finally the assembler
used for programs that are run on \textit{ChaosM}.
