\section{MCU} \label{section:mcu}

This chapter describes the modules that execute on the MCU. The MCU is
responsible for supplying the FPGA core \todo{FPGA core name here} with audio
samples. It also has to receive the results coming from the FPGA core after the
audio processing has taken place. In order to provide the samples from input and
output, the MCU controls a variety of input/output peripherals.

The software responsible for this is implemented on a Giant Gecko ARM Cortex-M3
microcontroller, manufactured by Silicon Labs. This MCU is a complete miniature
computer on a single chip. Due to the energy saving features, along with a
generally low power consumption, of this MCU is a good fit with the overall goal
of this project, namely energy efficiency.
