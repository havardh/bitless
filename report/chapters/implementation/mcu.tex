\section{MCU} \label{section:mcu}

The software is implemented on a Giant Gecko ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller, 
manufactured by Silicon Labs \todo{Mention EnergyMicro before this point}. 
This MCU, Microcontroller Unit, is a complete miniature computer on a single chip. 
The energy saving features, along with generally low power consumption, of this MCU 
makes it a good fit for the overall goal of this project, namely energy efficiency. 

This chapter describes the modules that execute on the MCU. The responsibility 
of this component is to supply the FPGA core \todo{FPGA core name here} with audio 
samples. It should also comsume the results after audio processing has taken 
place. In order to provide samples, the MCU controls a variety of Input/Output 
peripherals.
