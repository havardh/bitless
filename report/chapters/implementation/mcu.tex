\section{MCU} \label{section:mcu}

This chapter describes the modules that execute on the MCU. The MCU is
responsible for supplying \textit{ChaosM} with audio samples. It also has to
receive the results coming from the FPGA core after the audio processing has
taken place. In order to provide the samples from input and output, the MCU
controls a variety of input/output peripherals, which is why it also is referred to as the I/O controller throughout the report.

The software responsible for this is implemented on a Giant Gecko ARM Cortex-M3
microcontroller, manufactured by Silicon Labs. This MCU is a complete miniature
computer on a single chip. Due to the energy saving features, along with a
generally low power consumption, this MCU is a good fit with the overall goal
of this project, namely energy efficiency.
