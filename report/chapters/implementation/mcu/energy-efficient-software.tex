\subsection{Energy Efficient Software}

The software layer provides the most potential for energy savings, as the best
way to save power is to turn off the system completely. This descision is made
by the algorithm used. Still, a few techniques ensures that savings are posible even when the system 
is running. The most commonly know technique are {\bf interrupts}, in contrast to busy 
waiting. {\bf Sleep modes} are used for turning of parts of the system while still enabling 
some processing. {\bf DMA}, Direct Memory Access, enables movement of data while the
CPU is sleeping. 

The Giant Gecko provides 5 execution modes, where 4 modes are different levels of sleep. 
For this project sleep modes EM0, EM1 and EM3 was utilized.


\begin{description}
	\item[Energy Mode 0] - Run Mode \hfill \\
		Fully operational with all features available, used when handling interrupts and while reading from SDCard.
	\item[Energy Mode 1] - Sleep Mode \hfill \\
		CPU turned off, used when the system is performing filtering, required by EBI.
	\item[Energy Mode 3] - Stop Mode \hfill \\
		Deepest sleep mode without reset required, used when Bitless is idle.
