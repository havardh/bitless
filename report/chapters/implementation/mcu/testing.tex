\subsection{Testing}

Throughout the development of the software modules and libraries, tests in the form
of demo programs and separate unit tests have been used.

\subsubsection{Unit tests}

Unit tests was developed for the non-hardware dependent code. These include the
{\bf Circular Buffer} and {\bf FPGA} module.

\subsubsection{Demo Program}
The following demo programs were developed to test each component in separation.


\paragraph{ADD.c}
Sets up a simple path from ADC to DAC.
Verifies that ADC, DAC are setup correctly.

\paragraph{fpga.c}
Sets up a path from ADC through FGPA mock input register to DAC.
Verifies that deinterleaving and interleaving works.

\paragraph{copy-file.c}
Sets up MicroSD and copies the file sweet1.wav to sweet2.wav.
Verifies that SDCard is setup correctly.

\paragraph{wavplayer.c}
Sets up the MicroSD, FPGA mock, DAC and DMA.
Verifies that audio can be played from SDCard to DAC.
