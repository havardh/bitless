The software is implemented on an ARM Cortex-M3 supplied by
EnergyMicro. This chapter describes the modules that are
executed on this chip. The responsibility of the software
component is mainly producing samples that the FPGA consumes and
to consume the samples the FPGA produces as results.

It implements interfaces to the different I/O devices that the
system as a whole uses as source and destination for data
samples. These include ADC and DAC connected to Jack plugs on
the card and MicroSD card connected to the SDCard Slot. In
addition a serial port is available for communication with a PC.

This component also handles general I/O like buttons for
controlling the behavior for of the program at runtime, and LEDs
for visual feedback.

The last responsibility is providing a way to program the FPGA
cores. This functionality is used when the filters used on the
FPGA are configured. \todo[inline]{Most of this is too specific.
It should be a ``light'' introduction; needs to be rewritten. E.g.
give an overview of terminology (CPU vs MCU), what role the MCU
plays in the system compared to the rest, and why the chapter
has been structured so and so. -JK}
