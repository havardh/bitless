\subsection{Software Architecture}

\todo[inline]{FIX THE BELOW REFERENCES!!!!}

Since the microcontroller from Energy Micro which this project uses, in turn is
a Cortex microcontroller, the software is based on the CMSIS \ref{CMSIS}
codebase from ARM. The Giant Gecko MCU is supplied with a peripheral Application
Programming Interface (API), called emlib \ref{emlib}, which builds upon CMSIS
and can be used to both initialize and control all attached peripherals. The
structure of the code and programming model is based on how emlib does it. The
code and model have mostly used the emlib API for communicating and controlling
the microcontoller.

The application code is structured into directories representing each of the
modules, or peripherals, which we have written custom software for. Each module
\todo{WHY?}contains three directories, \textit{inc}, \textit{src} and \textit{demo}. Each
of these directories contains header files, source files and different demos or
test programs for the modules, respectively. Each module is typically
implemented as a combination of a driver and a controller for the specific
device that it is designed for.
