\section{PCB}\label{section:pcb}

While the main objective of the project, the creation of a MIMD system, can
essentially can be implemented by FPGA design alone, in an actual system, the
PCB is crucial for the realization of the system. This section is structured
according to the order in which the stages occured in the work process.
