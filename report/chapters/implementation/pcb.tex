\section{PCB}\label{section:pcb}

While the main objective of the project is to create a MIMD system, which
essentially can be completed by FPGA design alone, everything depends on the PCB
to complete the system. This section describes everything involved with the PCB
design, and every subsection has been placed according to which stage in the
process it occurred.
