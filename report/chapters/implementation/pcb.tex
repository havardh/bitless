\section{PCB}\label{chapter:pcb}

While the main objective of the project is to create a MIMD
system, which essentially can be completed by FPGA design alone,
everything depends on the PCB to complete the system. It is the
final step in realizing the system as a whole, going from a
theoretical dimension of design and ideas, to a physical one
with components and electricity.

The following sections have been
ordered as much as possible according to which stage in the
process they occurred.
