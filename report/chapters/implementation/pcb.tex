\section{PCB}\label{chapter:pcb}

While the main objective of the project is to create a MIMD
system, which essentially can be completed by FPGA design alone,
everything depends on the PCB to complete the system. It is the
final step in realizing the system as a whole, going from a
theoretical dimension of design and ideas, to a physical one
with components and electricity.

This chapter explains in detail each step taken during the
design process of the circuit board. The sections have been
ordered as much as possible according to which stage in the
process they occurred, with schematic drawings as the first
step, choice of components as the second, followed by layout,
and finally the test plan. In addition there is a section on
what went wrong and what was done to fix it. While we have tried
to divide these steps to our best ability, some of them are
intertwined, like schematics and components, as you need of
course to decide on what components your card will have before
actually drawing them, unless you have a particular fondness for
doing unnecessary work.
