\section{PCB}\label{chapter:pcb}

While the main objective of the project is to create a MIMD system, which
essentially can be completed by FPGA design alone, everything depends on the PCB
to complete the system. It is the final step in realizing the system as a whole,
going from a theoretical dimension of design and ideas, to a physical one with
components and electricity.

The following sections have been ordered as much as possible according to which
stage in the process they occurred.
