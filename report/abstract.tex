\section*{Abstract}

As single-core processor performance increase has slowed in recent years,
limited by power and memory latency, multi-core systems are becoming the norm.
Utilizing two or more cores in parallel to process data permits one to push
performance beyond that of a highly clocked single core. \newline

Setting up such a multicore system to take multiple instructions and multiple
data (MIMD), the workflow is not limited to data level parallelization like a
SIMD system would be. Asynchronous and independent cores also gives
opportunities for more energy effecient implementations. \newline

In this project the assignment has been to design and implement a MIMD system
architecture optimized for energy efficiency, with a specific target
application. The application chosen for the project has been audio processing,
with support for digital and analog I/O.
