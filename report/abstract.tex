\section*{Abstract}
As heat dissipation in processor designs increasingly becomes an issue,
multiprocessing has been identified as an effective source for performance
increase, without incurring the wrath of overheating. Utilizing two or more
cores in parallel to process data can be exploited to push performance beyond
that of a highly clocked single processor doing all the work.
\todo[inline]{Evaluate the below}
Setting up such
a system to take multiple instructions and multiple data (MIMD), the workflow
is not limited to data level parallelization like a SIMD system would be.\todo{ok until this point, but the section has to be rewritten from this point.} With the added requirement of a MIMD architecture in mind, we settled on sound manipulation as the basis for our project,
figuring that if we build an array of processors, every column can correspond
to a particular filter, while every row is a different sound channel.\newline
\todo[inline]{evaluate the above.}
Bitless consists of an FPGA configured to realize said processor array, with
I/O implemented by audio jack channels and various other peripherals like micro
USB and microSD, which in turn are controlled by a microcontroller unit (MCU).
Everything has been placed on a custom designed PCB, and has been designed with
a high level of energy efficiency in mind.\newline
\todo[inline]{mention something about the final performance of the system}
